    "## 4.1: The Reading Class\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first step, we want to write a class called Reading. The class should have attributes representing a city name, high temperature, low temperature, humidity, wind speed, snowfall amount, and rainfall amount. The city name must be initialized using a parameter argument. Values for the other attributes may be missing when the initializer is invoked. For any attribute that is not assigned a value, this attribute must be initialized with the proper value to indicate the attribute \"has no value.\" (Hint: there is a special value Python uses to signal \"no value.\")\n",

    "name\t| str\t| city name\t| Yes  \n",
    "hi_temp\tfloat\thigh temperature\tNo  \n",
    "lo_temp\tfloat\tlow temperature\tNo  \n",
    "hum\tfloat\tpercent humidity\tNo  \n",

    "When instantiating a `Reading` object and optional parameter arguments are excluded, your class `__init__()` method must still execute successfully. For example, these are all valid ways of initializing a Reading object:\n",

    "\n",
    "`example3 = Reading(name=\"New York\", hi_temp=37, lo_temp=32, hum=45)`  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Reading class should include a method, called `average_temp()`, that returns the mean (i.e. average) of the high and low temperatures. If either high and/or low temperatures were missing when the Reading object was initialized, the average_temp() method must return a value to show that there is no valid average.\n",
